# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

- Used optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators to make the code more concise and easier to read. These operators help to avoid unnecessary checks for undefined or null values.

- Reordered the code for better readability. The main logic of determining the partition key is now consolidated in a single line.

- Removed unnecessary comments and variable declarations for better clarity.

- Used template literals to concatenate string values, making the code more concise and easier to read.

- Refactored the if (candidate) statement to a single line using a ternary operator for better readability.

- Changed the exports keyword to export default syntax to be more consistent with modern JS module exports.

By refactoring the code in this way, we've made it more concise and easier to read. We've also taken advantage of modern JS features to simplify the logic and make it more efficient. The code is now more organized and easier to understand, with better variable names and less repetition.
